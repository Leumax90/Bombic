<h1 align="center">Bombic</h1>
Bombic was designed with a focus on mobile devices, but you can try playing it in your browser by following the link https://play.unity.com/mg/other/bombic-np. The goal of the game is for the player to reach the finish by overcoming obstacles in the form of crystals. Movement is limited to forward or backward. Projectiles in the form of bombs can be shot at the crystals; the longer the player holds the fire button, the larger the projectile and, consequently, the more crystals can be destroyed. However, with each shot, the player decreases in size proportionally to the size of the created projectile until becoming too small to progress forward and reach the finish. Therefore, use the shooting power wisely.

Enjoy the game!
